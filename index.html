            Long afloat on shipless oceans<br>
            I did all my best to smile<br>
            'Til your singing eyes and fingers<br>
            Drew me loving to your isle<br>
            And you sang<br>
            Sail to me<br>
            Sail to me<br>
            Let me enfold you<br>
            Here I am<br>
            Here I am<br>
            Waiting to hold you<br>
            Did I dream you dreamed about me?<br>
            Were you here when I was forced out<br>
            Now my foolish boat is leaning<br>
            Broken lovelorn on your rocks<br>
            For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow<br>
            Oh my heart, Oh my heart shies from the sorrow"<br>
            Well I'mâ€¦
